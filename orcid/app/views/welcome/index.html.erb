      <p>York University is collecting your ORCID iD to understand the level of ORCID adoption within its research communities. When you click the “Authorize” button, we will ask you to share your iD using an authenticated process: either by <a href="<%= orcid_authorize_url %>">registering for an ORCID iD</a> or, if you already have one, by <a href="<%= orcid_authorize_url %>">signing into your ORCID account</a>, then granting us permission to get your ORCID iD. We do this to ensure that you are correctly identified and securely connecting your ORCID iD.

        <h2>What is an ORCID iD?</h2>
        <p>An ORCID iD is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers and a record that supports automatic links among all your professional activities. Your ORCID iD and connections are stored in the ORCID Registry, in an account you own and manage.</p>

        <h2>Why register for an ORCID iD?</h2>
        <p>An ORCID iD: 
          <ul>
            <li>ensures your research outputs and activities are correctly attributed to you</li>
            <li>connects you with your contributions and affiliations</li>
            <li>improves discoverability for you and your research outputs</li>
            <li>reduces form-filling</li>
            <li>is interoperable (works with many funders and publishers)</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Can I manage my ORCID record?</h2>
        <p>You control your ORCID record, including what information is connected to your iD; what is publicly available, private, or shared with trusted third parties; and which third parties you share information with.</p>
